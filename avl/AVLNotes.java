	 * AVL trees is the last topic
	 * balance is important in BSTs (unbalanced is O(n), not O(logn))
	 * rotations of BSTs conserve the BST. crucial for self-balancing trees
	 * balance is difference of height of left tree and height of left tree
	 * balance  = h(r) - h(1)
	 * AVL tree - BST where the balance of every node is in the interval [-1, +1]
	 * 
	 * for rotations, you either need 1 or 2 rotations. You look for the lowest node that is a +2
	 * or something, and once you fix that one, everything should be fixed
	 * R-R or R-L case
